# Algorithm & Design

## Introduction

We will assume that we are given a dataframe `df` which details events that have happened to subjects. Each
row in the dataframe will have a `subject_id` column which identifies the subject, and a `timestamp` column
which identifies the timestamp at which the event the row is describing happened. `df` would be constructed
to have unique `subject_id` and `timestamp` pairs.

We will also assume this dataframe has a collection of columns which describe the event in a variety of ways.
These columns can either have a binary value (1/0) representing whether certain properties are True/False for
each row's event, or a count (integer) for the number of times that certain properties hold within each row's
event. We'll call these additional properties/columns "predicates" over the events, as they can often be
interpreted as boolean or count functions over the event.

For example, we may consider a dataframe `df_clincial_events` that quantifies clinical events happening to
patients, with predicates `"is_admission"`, `"is_discharge"`, `"is_death"`, and `"is_covid_dx"`, like this:

| `subject_id` | `timestamp`         | `is_admission` | `is_discharge` | `is_death` | `is_covid_dx` |
| ------------ | ------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ---------- | ------------- |

| 2            | 2020-01-02 10:18:29 | 0              | 0              | 0          | 0             |
| 2            | 2020-01-02 16:18:29 | 0              | 0              | 0          | 1             |
| 2            | 2020-01-03 14:47:31 | 0              | 0              | 1          | 0             |
| 3            | 2020-01-01 12:03:31 | 1              | 0              | 0          | 0             |
| 3            | 2020-01-02 12:03:31 | 0              | 1              | 0          | 0             |
| 3            | 2022-01-01 12:03:31 | 1              | 0              | 0          | 0             |
| 3            | 2022-01-06 12:03:31 | 0              | 0              | 1          | 0             |

In this case, we have 3 subjects (patients), which have the following respective approximate time series of
events:

- Subject 1 is admitted, has 3 events that don't satisfy any predicates, is discharged, dies, and has no
  further events.
- Subject 2 is admitted, has an event that satisfies no predicate, has a COVID diagnosis, dies, and has no
  further events.
- Subject 3 is admitted, then is discharged, then is admitted again, and then dies.

Events that don't satisfy any predicates in this particular case could represent a variety of other events in
the medical record, such as a lab test, a procedure, or a non-COVID diagnosis, just to name a few.

Given data like this, our algorithm is designed to extract valid start and end times of "windows" within a
subject's time series that satisfy certain inclusion and exclusion criteria and are defined with temporal and
event-bounded constraints. We can use this algorithm to automatically extract windows of interest from the
record, including but not limited to data cohorts and downstream task labeled datasets for machine learning
applications.

We will specify these windows using a configuration file language that is ultimately interpreted into a tree
structure. For example, suppose we wish to extract a dataset for the prediction of in-hospital mortality from
the data defined in the above `df_clincial_events` dataframe, such that we wish to include the first 24 hours
of data of each hospitalization as an input to a model, and predict whether the patient will die within the
hospital. Suppose we also subject the dataset to constraints where the admission in question must be at least
48 hours in length and that the patient must not have a COVID diagnosis within that admission.

We might then specify these windows using the defined predicates in the configuration file language as
follows:

```yaml
trigger: is_admission
gap:
  start: trigger
  end: trigger + 48h
  excludes:
    - is_discharge
    - is_death
    - is_covid_dx
target:
  start: gap.end
  end: is_discharge | is_death
  label: is_death
  excludes:
    - is_covid_dx
input:
  end: trigger + 24h
```

<!-- I think should include a timeline similar to the ones on the README to visualize this -->

Given that our machine learning model seeks to predict in-hospital mortality, our dataset should include both
positive and negative samples (patients that died in the hospital and patients that didn't die). Hence, the
`target` "window" concludes at either a `"is_death"` event (patients that died) or a`"is_discharge"` event
(patients that didn't die).

Note that this is pseudocode and not the actual configuration language, which may look slightly different.
Nevertheless, we can see that this set of specifications can be realized in a "valid" form for a patient if
there exist a set of time points such that, within 48 hours after an admission, there are no discharges,
deaths, or COVID diagnoses, and that there exists a discharge or death event after the first 48 hours of
an admission where there were no COVID diagnoses between the end of that first 48 hours and the subsequent
discharge or death event.

Note that these windows form a naturally hierarchical, tree-based structure based on their relative
dependencies on one another. In particular, we can realize the following tree structure constructed by nodes
inferred for the above configuration:

```
- Trigger
  - Gap Start (Trigger)
    - Gap End (Gap Start + 48h)
      - Target Start (Gap End)
        - Target End (subsequent "is_discharge" or "is_death")
  - Input End
```

Our algorithm will naturally rely on this hierarchical structure by performing a set of recursive database
search operations to extract the windows that satisfy the constraints of the configuration file by recursing
over each subtree to find windows that satisfy the constraints of those subtrees individually.

In the rest of this document, we will detail how our algorithm automatically extracts records that meet
these criteria, the terminology we use to describe our algorithm (both here and in the raw source code and
code comments), and the limitations of this algorithm and kinds of tasks it cannot yet express. Details about
the true configuration language that is used in practice to specify "windows" can be found in [configuration](https://eventstreamaces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html). MIMIC-IV examples are available in [examples](https://eventstreamaces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html).

## Algorithm Terminology

#### Event

An "event" in our dataset is a unique timestamp that occurs for a given subject.

#### Predicate

A "predicate" is a boolean or count function that can be applied to an event to describe the observations that
an underlying dataset included within the timestamp of that event. They will often be boolean functions at the
beginning of the process, but become aggregated into count functions when summarizing windows, so will be
thought of as count functions to capture this generality throughout the algorithm as it rarely, if ever,
necessary to distinguish between the two.

#### Window

A "window" is just a time range capturing some portion of a subject's record. It can be inclusive or exclusive
on either endpoint, and may or may not have endpoints corresponding to an extant event in the dataset, as
opposed to a time point at which no event occurred.

Time is treated as strictly increasing in our algorithm (ie., the start of a "window" will always be before or
equal to the end of that "window").

#### A "Root" of a Subtree

A subtree in the hierarchy of constraint windows has a "root" node in the tree, which corresponds to the start
or end of a "window" in the set of constraints. For example, the "Gap End" node in the tree above is the root
of the subtree `Gap End -> Target Start -> Target End`.

#### A "Realized" Subtree of Constraint Windows

A subtree in the hierarchy of constraint windows can be _realized_ in a patient dataset by finding a set of
timestamps such that the windows of events they bound satisfy the constraints of the subtree. For instance,
using our example in-hospital mortality task above, the subtree `Gap End -> Target Start -> Target End` would
be _realized_ if, given the "Gap End" timestamp, we can find:

- A timestamp for "Target Start", which is equal to the timestamp of "Gap End" in this example.
- A timestamp for "Target End", which should be equal to the timestamp of a `"is_death"` or `"is_discharge"`
  event and there are no `"is_covid_dx"` events between the timestamp of "Target Start" and the timestamp of
  "Target End".

#### An "Anchor" or "Anchor Event" of a Subtree

A subtree in the hierarchy of constraint windows that can be _realized_ in a real patient's record will have
one **most recent** ancestor node whose timestamp will correspond to the timestamp of a real event in the
patient record. This node is called the "anchor" of the subtree. For example, in any realization of the tree
above, the admission event matched by the "Trigger" node will be the anchor of the realization of the
`Gap End -> Target Start -> Target End` subtree, as the Gap End is defined via a relative time gap to the
admission event and thus cannot be guaranteed to correspond to an extant event in the patient record. However,
the admission event of the `Trigger` node will always correspond to an extant event in the patient record and
exist in the dataset proper.

This notion of an _anchor_ will be useful in the algorithm as it will correspond to rows from which we will
perform temporal and event-based aggregations to determine whether windows satisfy subtree constraints.

## Algorithm Design

### Initialization

#### Inputs

<!-- TODO: -->

#### Computation

<!-- TODO: -->

### Recursive Step

#### Inputs

In our recursive step, we will be given the following inputs:

##### `predicates_df`

The `predicates_df` dataframe will contain all events and their predicates. This will not be modified across
recursive steps.

##### `subtree_anchor_to_subtree_root_df`

The `subtree_anchor_to_subtree_root_df` dataframe will contain rows corresponding to the timestamps of a
superset of all possible valid anchor events for realizations of the subtree over which we are recursing (a
superset as if there exist no valid realizations of subtrees, then a prospective anchor would be invalid - if
we can find a valid subtree realization for a prospective anchor in this input dataframe, said anchor would be
a true valid anchor).

<!-- This one above really confused me, will need to revisit -->

This dataframe will also contain the counts of predicates between the prospective anchor events indexed by the
rows of this dataframe and the corresponding possible root timestamps of the subtree over which we are
recursing. This information will be necessary to compute the proper counts within a "window" during the
recursive step.

##### `offset`

In the event that the subtree root timestamp is not the same as the subtree anchor timestamp (there may be a
temporal offset between the two), the `offset` will be the difference between the two timestamps. If the two
are not the same, they will guaranteed to be separated by a constant `offset` because the subtree root will
either correspond to a fixed time delta from the subtree anchor or will be an actual event itself, in which
case it will be the subtree anchor.

#### Computation

In the recursive step, we will iterate over all children of the subtree root node. For each child, we will
do the following:

##### Aggregate Predicates over the Relevant "Window"

First, we will aggregate the predicates from `predicates_df` over the rows corresponding to the "window"
spanning the root of the subtree to the root of the selected child. This aggregation step will always return a
dataframe keyed by the `subject_id` column as well as by any possible prospective realizations of anchor
events for the _subtree rooted at the selected child node_. This computation will take one of two forms:

###### Temporal Aggregation

If the edge linking the subtree root to the child is a temporal relationship (e.g., in our example above, the
"Gap End" node is defined as a fixed time delta from the "Gap Start" node), we will aggregate the predicates
by using a "rolling" (or "temporal" group-by) operation on the `predicates_df` dataframe, summarizing time
windows of the appropriate size and grouping by the `subject_id` column. We will perform this aggregation
globally over the predicates dataframe, leveraging the determined edge time delta and the passed `offset`
parameter (such that we compute the aggregation over the correct "window" in time from any possible
realization of the subtree anchor) and then filter the resulting dataframe to only include rows corresponding
to said possible subtree anchors. As a temporal edge means the anchor of the child subtree is the same as the
anchor of the passed subtree, this suffices for our intended computation, and we can return it directly.

###### Event-bound Aggregation

If the edge linking the subtree root to the child is an event-bound relationship (e.g., in our example above,
the "Target End" node is defined as the first subsequent `"is_discharge"` or `"is_death"` event after the
"Target Start" node), we will aggregate the predicates by using a custom row-predicate-bound aggregation over
the database that will be implemented using differences of cumulative sums within the global `predicates_df`
dataframe. In particular, we will first construct the following three dataframes from our inputs:

1. A dataframe that contains the cumulative count of all predicates seen up until each event (row) in the
   `predicates_df`.
2. A dataframe that contains nulls in each row that does not correspond to a possible prospective
   realization of a child anchor event given the edge constraints and the possible prospective subtree
   anchor events and the specified `offset`, and contains a `True` value otherwise.
3. A dataframe that contains nulls in each row that does not correspond to a possible prospective
   realization of this subtree's anchor event and contains a `True` value otherwise.

From these three dataframes, we can then forward fill (in time) the cumulative counts of each predicate seen
at each prospective subtree anchor event up to the next subsequent possible child anchor node, and take the
difference between the two to compute the relative counts for each predicate column between each successive
pair of subtree anchor events and child anchor events, keyed by child anchor. We must then also subtract the
counts seen between the subtree anchor events and the subtree root events to ensure we are only capturing the
events between the correct subtree root and child root.

##### Filter on Constraints

Next, with these new "window" counts, we can validate that any inclusion or exclusion criteria are upheld, and
if not, remove those subtrees as possible realizations of the "window" before proceeding to the next
computational step.

##### Recurse through the child subtree

With this filtered set of possible prospective child anchor nodes, we can now recurse through the child
subtree.
