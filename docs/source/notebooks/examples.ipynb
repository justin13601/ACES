    "\n",
    "To capture our task definition, we must define at least three predicates. Recall that these predicates are dataset-specific, and thus may be different depending on the data standard used or data schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "For starters, we are specifically interested in mortality \"in the hospital\". As such, an `admission` and a `discharge` predicate would be needed to represent events where patients are officially admitted \"into\" the hospital and where patients are officially discharged \"out of\" the hospital. We also need the `death` predicate to capture death events so we can accurately capture the mortality component. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since our task endpoints could be either `discharge` or `death` (ie., binary label prediction), we may also create a derived predicate `discharge_or_death` which is expressed by an `OR` relationship between `discharge` and `death`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trigger\n",
    "\n",
    "A prediction can be made for each event specified in `trigger`. This field must contain one of the previously defined dataset-specific predicates. In our case, we'd like to make a prediction of mortality for each valid admission in our cohort, and thus we set `trigger` to be the `admission` predicate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "The windows section contains the remaining three windows we defined previously - `input`, `gap`, and `target`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`input` begins at the start of a patient's record (ie., `NULL`), and ends 24 hours past `trigger` (ie., `admission`). As we'd like to include the events specified at both the start and end of `input`, if present, we can set both `start_inclusive` and `end_inclusive` as `True`. Our constraint on the number of records is specified in `has` using the `_ANY_EVENT` predicate, with its value set to be greater or equal to 5 (ie., unbounded parameter on the right as seen in `(5, None)`). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Since we'd like to make a prediction at the end of `input`, we can set `index_timestamp` to be `end`, which corresponds to the timestamp of `trigger + 24h`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`gap` also begins at `trigger`, and ends 48 hours after. As we have already included the left boundary event in `trigger` (ie., `admission`), it would be reasonable to **not** include it again as it should not play a role in `gap`. As such, we set `start_inclusive` to `False`. As we'd like our admission to be at least 48 hours long, we can place constraints specifying that there cannot be any `admission`, `discharge`, or `death` in `gap` (ie., right-bounded parameter at `0` as seen in `(None, 0)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "`target` begins at the end of `gap`, and ends at the next discharge or death event (ie., `discharge_or_death` predicate). We can use this arrow notation which ACES recognizes as event references (ie., `->` and `<-`; see [Time Range Fields](https://eventstreamaces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical.html#time-range-fields)). In our case, we end `target` at the next `discharge_or_death`. Similarly, as we included the event at the end of `gap`, if any, already in `gap`, we can set `start_inclusive` to `False`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Since we'd like to make a binary mortality prediction, we can extract the `death` predicate as a label from `target`, by specifying the `label` field to be `death`."

For instance, you may only be interested in predicting imminent mortality within an admission. In this case, you might create `admission_window`, starting from `admission` predicates to `discharge_or_death` predicates.
