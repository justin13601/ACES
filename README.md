# Automatic Cohort Extraction System for Event-Streams

Automatic Cohort Extraction System (ACES) is a library that streamlines the extraction of task-specific cohorts from time series datasets formatted as event-streams, such as Electronic Health Records (EHR). ACES is designed to query these EHR datasets for valid subjects, guided by various constraints and requirements defined in a YAML task configuration file. This offers a powerful and user-friendly solution to researchers and developers. The use of a human-readable YAML configuration file also eliminates the need for users to be proficient in complex dataframe querying, making the extraction process accessible to a broader audience.

There are diverse applications in healthcare and beyond. For instance, researchers can effortlessly define subsets of EHR datasets for training of foundation models. Retrospective analyses can also become more accessible to clinicians as it enables the extraction of tailored cohorts for studying specific medical conditions or population demographics.

Currently, two data standards are directly supported: the [Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS)](https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard/meds) standard and the [EventStreamGPT (ESGPT)](https://github.com/mmcdermott/EventStreamGPT) standard. You must format your in one of these two formats by following instructions in their respective repositories. ACES also supports ***any*** arbitrary dataset schema, provided you extract the necessary dataset-specific plain predicates and format it as an event-stream. More information about this is available below and [here](https://eventstreamaces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/predicates.html).

This README provides an overview of this tool, instructions for use, and a description of the fields in the task configuration file (see configs in `sample_configs/`). Please refer to the [ACES Documentation](https://eventstreamaces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for more detailed information.

## Dependencies

- polars == 0.20.\*
- bigtree == 0.18.\*
- ruamel.yaml == 0.18.\*
- loguru == 0.7.\*
- hydra-core == 1.3.\*
- pytimeparse == 1.1.\*
- networkx == 3.3.\*
- pyarrow == 16.1.\*

## Installation

1. If using the ESGPT data standard, install [EventStreamGPT (ESGPT)](https://github.com/mmcdermott/EventStreamGPT):

Clone EventStreamGPT:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmcdermott/EventStreamGPT.git
```

Install with dependencies from the root directory of the cloned repo:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

**Note**: To avoid potential dependency conflicts, please install ESGPT first before installing ACES. This ensures compatibility with the `polars` version required by ACES.

2. Install ACES:

```bash
pip install es-aces
```

## Instructions for Use

1. **Prepare a Task Configuration File**: Define your predicates and task windows according to your research needs. Please see below or [here](https://eventstreamaces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html) for details regarding the configuration language.
2. **Get Predicates DataFrame**: Process your dataset according to instructions for the [MEDS](https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard/meds) or [ESGPT](https://github.com/mmcdermott/EventStreamGPT) standard so you can leverage ACES to automatically create the predicates dataframe. You can also create your own predicates dataframe directly (more information below and [here](https://eventstreamaces.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/predicates.html)).
3. **Execute Query**: A query may be executed using either the command-line interface or by importing the package in Python:

### Command-Line Interface:

```bash
aces-cli data.path='/path/to/data/file/or/directory' data.standard='<esgpt/meds/direct>' cohort_dir='/directory/to/task/config/' cohort_name='<task_config_name>'
```

For help using `aces-cli`:

```bash
aces-cli --help
```

### Python Code:

```python
from aces import config, predicates, query
from omegaconf import DictConfig

# create task configuration object
cfg = config.TaskExtractorConfig.load(config_path="/path/to/task/config/task.yaml")

# get predicates dataframe
data_config = DictConfig(
    {
        "path": "/path/to/data/file/or/directory",
        "standard": "<esgpt/meds/direct>",
        "ts_format": "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M",
    }
)
predicates_df = predicates.get_predicates_df(cfg=cfg, data_config=data_config)

# execute query and get results
df_result = query.query(cfg=cfg, predicates_df=predicates_df)
```

4. **Results**: The output will be a dataframe of subjects who satisfy the conditions defined in your task configuration file. Timestamps for the start/end boundaries of each window specified in the task configuration, as well as predicate counts for each window, are also provided. Below are sample logs for the successful extraction of an in-hospital mortality cohort using the ESGPT standard:

## Task Configuration File

The task configuration file allows users to define specific predicates and windows to query your dataset. Below is a sample generic configuration file in its most basic form:

```yaml
predicates:
  predicate_1:
    code: ???
  ...

trigger: ???

windows:
  window_1:
    start: ???
    end: ???
    start_inclusive: ???
    end_inclusive: ???
    has:
      predicate_1: (???, ???)

    label: ???
    index_timestamp: ???
  ...
```

Sample task configuration files for 6 common tasks are provided in `sample_configs/`. All task configurations can be directly extracted using `'direct'` model on `sample_data/sample_data.csv` as this predicates dataframe was designed specifically to capture predicates needed for all tasks. However, only `inhospital_mortality.yaml` and `imminent-mortality.yaml` would be able to be extracted on `sample_data/esgpt_sample` and `sample_data/meds_sample` due to a lack of required predicates.

### Predicates

Predicates describe the event at a timestamp and are used to create predicate columns that contain predicate counts for each row of your dataset. If the MEDS or ESGPT data standard is used, ACES automatically computes the predicates dataframe needed for the query from the `predicates` fields in your task configuration file. However, you may also choose to construct your own predicates dataframe should you not wish to use the MEDS or ESGPT data standard.

Example predicates dataframe `.csv`:

```
subject_id,timestamp,death,admission,discharge,covid,death_or_discharge,_ANY_EVENT
1,12/1/1989 12:03,0,1,0,0,0,1
1,12/1/1989 13:14,0,0,0,0,0,1
1,12/1/1989 15:17,0,0,0,0,0,1
1,12/1/1989 16:17,0,0,0,0,0,1
1,12/1/1989 20:17,0,0,0,0,0,1
1,12/2/1989 3:00,0,0,0,0,0,1
1,12/2/1989 9:00,0,0,0,0,0,1
1,12/2/1989 15:00,0,0,1,0,1,1
```

There are two types of predicates that can be defined in the configuration file, "plain" predicates, and "derived" predicates.

#### Plain Predicates

"Plain" predicates represent explicit values (either `str` or `int`) in your dataset at a particular timestamp and has 1 required `code` field (for string categorical variables) and 4 optional fields (for integer or float continuous variables). For instance, the following defines a predicate representing normal SpO2 levels (a range of 90-120 corresponding to rows where the `lab` column is `O2 saturation pulseoxymetry (%)`):

```yaml
normal_spo2:
  code: lab//O2 saturation pulseoxymetry (%)     # required <str>//<str>
  value_min: 90                                  # optional <float/int>
  value_max: 120                                 # optional <float/int>
  value_min_inclusive: true                      # optional <bool>
  value_max_inclusive: true                      # optional <bool>
```

Fields for a "plain" predicate:

- `code` (required): Must be a string with `//` sequence separating the column name and column value.
- `value_min` (optional): Must be float or integer specifying the minimum value of the predicate, if the variable is presented as numerical values.
- `value_max` (optional): Must be float or integer specifying the maximum value of the predicate, if the variable is presented as numerical values.
- `value_min_inclusive` (optional): Must be a boolean specifying whether `value_min` is inclusive or not.
- `value_max_inclusive` (optional): Must be a boolean specifying whether `value_max` is inclusive or not.

#### Derived Predicates

"Derived" predicates combine existing "plain" predicates using `and` or `or` keywords and have exactly 1 required `expr` field: For instance, the following defines a predicate representing either death or discharge (by combining "plain" predicates of `death` and `discharge`):

```yaml
# plain predicates
discharge:
  code: event_type//DISCHARGE
death:
  code: event_type//DEATH

# derived predicates
discharge_or_death:
  expr: or(discharge, death)
```

Field for a "derived" predicate:

- `expr`: Must be a string with the 'and()' or 'or()' key sequences, with "plain" predicates as its constituents.

A special predicate `_ANY_EVENT` is always defined, which simply represents any event, as the name suggests. This predicate can be used like any other predicate manually defined (ie., setting a constraint on its occurrence or using it as a trigger, more information below).

#### Special Predicates

There are also a few special predicates that you can use. These *do not* need to be defined explicitly in the configuration file, and can be directly used:

`_ANY_EVENT`: specifies any event in the data (ie., effectively set to `1` for every single row in your predicates dataframe)

`_RECORD_START`: specifies the beginning of a patient's record (ie., effectively set to `1` in the first chronological row for every `subject_id`)

`_RECORD_END`: specifies the end of a patient's record (ie., effectively set to `1` in the last chronological row for every `subject_id`)

### Trigger Event

The trigger event is a simple field with a value of a predicate name. For each trigger event, a predication by a model can be made. For instance, in the following example, the trigger event is an admission. Therefore, in your task, a prediction by a model can be made for each valid admission (after extraction according to other task specifications).

```yaml
predicates:
  admission:
    code: event_type//ADMISSION

trigger: admission                    # trigger event <predicate>
```

### Windows

Windows can be of two types, a temporally-bounded window or an event-bounded window. Below is a sample temporally-bounded window configuration:

```
trigger: admission

input:
  start: NULL
  end: trigger + 24h
  start_inclusive: True
  end_inclusive: True
  has:
    _ANY_EVENT: (5, None)
```

In this example, the window `input` begins at `NULL` (ie., the first event or the start of the time series record), and ends at 24 hours after the `trigger` event, which is specified to be a hospital admission. The window is inclusive on both ends (ie., both the first event and the event at 24 hours after the admission, if any, is included in this window). Finally, a constraint of 5 events of any kind is placed so any valid window would include sufficient data.

Two fields (`start` and `end`) are required to define the size of a window. Both fields must be a string referencing a predicate name, or a string referencing the `start` or `end` field of another window name. In addition, it may express a temporal relationship by including a positive or negative time period expressed as a string (ie., `+ 2 days`, `- 365 days`, `+ 12h`, `- 30 minutes`, `+ 60s`). It may also express an event relationship by including a sequence with a directional arrow and a predicate name (ie., `-> predicate_1` or `<- predicate_1`). Finally, it may also contain `NULL`, indicating the first/last event for the `start`/`end` field, respectively.

`start_inclusive` and `end_inclusive` are required booleans specifying whether the events, if any, at the `start` and `end` points of the window are included in the window.

The `has` field specifies constraints relating to predicates within the window. For each predicate defined previously, a constraint for occurrences can be set using a string in the format of `(<min>, <max>)`. Unbounded conditions can be specified by using `None` or leaving it empty (ie., `(5, None)`, `(8,)`, `(None, 32)`, `(,10)`).

`label` is an optional field and can only exist in ONE window in the task configuration file if defined. It must be a string matching a defined predicate name, and is used to extract the label for the task.

`index_timestamp` is an optional field and can only exist in ONE window in the task configuration file if defined. It must be either `start` or `end`, and is used to create an index column used to easily manipulate the results output. Usually, one would set it to be the time at which the prediction would be made (ie., set to `end` in your window containing input data). Please ensure that you are validating your interpretation of `index_timestamp` for your task. For instance, if `index_timestamp` is set to the `end` of a particular window, the timestamp would be the event at the window boundary. However, in some cases, your task may want to exclude this boundary event, so ensure you are correctly interpreting the timestamp during extraction.

## FAQs

### Static Data

Support for static data depends on your data standard and those variables are expressed. For instance, in MEDS, it is feasible to express static data as a predicate, and thus criteria can be set normally. However, this is not yet incorporated for ESGPT. If a predicates dataframe is directly used, you may create a predicate column that specifies your static variable.

### Complementary Tools

ACES is an integral part of the MEDS ecosystem. To fully leverage its capabilities, you can utilize it alongside other complementary MEDS tools, such as:

- [MEDS-ETL](https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard/meds_etl), which can be used to transform various data schemas, including some command data models, into the MEDS format.
- [MEDS-TAB](https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard/meds_etl), which can be used generate automated tabular baseline methods (ie., XGBoost over ACES-defined tasks).
- [MEDS-Polars](https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard/meds_etl), which contains polars-based ETL scripts.

### Alternative Tools

There are existing alternatives for cohort extraction that focus on specific common data models, such as [i2b2 PIC-SURE](https://pic-sure.org/) and [OHDSI ATLAS](https://atlas.ohdsi.org/).

ACES serves as a middle ground between PIC-SURE and ATLAS. While it may offer less capability than PIC-SURE, it compensates with greater ease of use and improved communication value. Compared to ATLAS, ACES provides greater capability, though with slightly lower ease of use, yet it still maintains a higher communication value.

Finally, ACES is not tied to a particular common data model. Built on a flexible event-stream format, ACES is a no-code solution with a descriptive input format, permitting easy and wide iteration over task definitions, and can be applied to a variety of schemas, making it a versatile tool suitable for diverse research needs.
